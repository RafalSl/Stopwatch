Stopwatch app written in Java Swing, using multithreading (Timer and Executor) (almost done).

Counts miliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours and laps' times. Resets after 24 h.
Works almost the same as stopwatch in iPhone's.

BUGS: 
1. As there are different methods counting elapsed time and lap's time miscounts lap's time when stopped and restarted (counts time from the latest restart.
2. GUI elements need alignment.

Basic code written on programming bootcamp in end of May 2017, later on developed after hours.
